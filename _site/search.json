It works like building blocks—using the + operator to stack points, lines, and labels. This makes the code logic incredibly clear and much easier to maintain or modify.\nI also feel it saves a lot of time because it handles so much automatically. Once I map a column to an axis or a color, it takes care of the scaling and legend generation for me. It’s far more efficient than the manual setup required in Base R.\n\n3.Compared to Base R, I find it much more powerful for multi-dimensional data. With just a single line like facet_wrap, I can instantly generate sub-plots for different categories, which is the best way to visualize and compare trends across groups."

    "text": "3 Grammar of Graphics\n\n3.1 Introduction\nThe “Grammar of Graphics” framework was first proposed by Leland Wilkinson in 1999. It breaks down complex visualizations into semantic components, such as Scales and Layers, essentially defining the fundamental nature of what a statistical graphic is.\nThe core of the Grammar of Graphics lies in defining a set of rules for structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph. The theory is built upon two key principles:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n\n3.2 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics.  There are seven grammars of ggplot2:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."
