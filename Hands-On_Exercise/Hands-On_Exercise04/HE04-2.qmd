## Overview

In this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on using:

-   ggstatsplot package to create visual graphics with rich statistical information,

-   performance package to visualise model diagnostics, and

-   parameters package to visualise model parameters

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Visual Statistical Analysis with ggstatsplot

[ggstatsplot](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/index.html) is an extension of [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves.

-   To provide alternative statistical inference methods by default.
-   To follow best practices for statistical reporting. For all statistical tests reported in the plots, the default template abides by the [APA](https://my.ilstu.edu/~jhkahn/apastats.html) gold standard for statistical reporting. For example, here are results from a robust t-test:

### 1.2 Installing and launching R packages

In this exercise, **ggstatsplot** and **tidyverse** will be used.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, tidyverse)
```

### 1.3 Data import

For the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.

In the code chunk below, [read_csv()](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package is used to import *Exam_data.csv* into R and saved it into a tibble data.frame.

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## 2 Visual Statistical Analysis with ggstatsplot

### 2.1 One-sample test: gghistostats() method

In the code chunk below, [gghistostats()](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/gghistostats.html) is used to to build an visual of one-sample test on English scores.

::: panel-tabset
### Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false

set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)

```

### Code

```{r}
#| eval: false

set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)

```

Default information: - statistical details - Bayes Factor - sample sizes - distribution summary

### 2.2 Unpacking the Bayes Factor

- A Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.

- That’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.

- When we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as

The [Schwarz criterion](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bayesian-information-criterion/) is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.

### 2.3 How to interpret Bayes Factor

A **Bayes Factor** can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by [Lee and Wagenmakers](https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.smu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.1999.10474443?needAccess=true) in 2013:

### 2.4  Two-sample mean test: ggbetweenstats()

In the code chunk below, [ggbetweenstats()](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.

### Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = GENDER, 
  y = MATHS,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE
)

```

### Code

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = GENDER, 
  y = MATHS,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE
)

```

### 2.5 Oneway ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method

In the code chunk below, [ggbetweenstats()](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.

::: panel-tabset
### Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "p",
  mean.ci = TRUE, 
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
  pairwise.display = "s",
  p.adjust.method = "fdr",
  messages = FALSE
)

```

### Code

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "p",
  mean.ci = TRUE, 
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
  pairwise.display = "s",
  p.adjust.method = "fdr",
  messages = FALSE
)

```

- “ns” → only non-significant
- “s” → only significant
- “all” → everything

### 2.7 Significant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats()

In the code chunk below, ggscatterstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.

::: panel-tabset
### Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggscatterstats(
  data = exam,
  x = MATHS,
  y = ENGLISH,
  marginal = FALSE,
  )

```

### Code

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggscatterstats(
  data = exam,
  x = MATHS,
  y = ENGLISH,
  marginal = FALSE,
  )

### 2.8 Significant Test of Association (Depedence) : ggbarstats() methods

In the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using [cut()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/cut).

```{r}
exam1 <- exam %>% 
  mutate(MATHS_bins = 
           cut(MATHS, 
               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))
)
```

In this code chunk below ggbarstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association

::: panel-tabset
### Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggbarstats(exam1, 
           x = MATHS_bins, 
           y = GENDER)

```

### Code

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggbarstats(exam1, 
           x = MATHS_bins, 
           y = GENDER)
